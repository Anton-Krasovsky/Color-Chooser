/Users/antonkrasovsky/AndroidStudioProjects/ColorChooser/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:17: Warning: Redundant label can be removed [RedundantLabel]
            android:label="@string/app_name"
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "RedundantLabel":
   When an activity does not have a label attribute, it will use the one from
   the application tag. Since the application has already specified the same
   label, the label on this activity can be omitted.

   Explanation for issues of type "AndroidGradlePluginVersion":
   This detector looks for usage of the Android Gradle Plugin where the
   version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older
   versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick
   with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more
   recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.
   ,

   Available options:

   **skip-libraries** (default is true):
   Whether the unused resource check should skip reporting unused resources in libraries.

   Many libraries will declare resources that are part of the library surface; other modules depending on the library will also reference the resources. To avoid reporting all these resources as unused (in the context of a library), the unused resource check normally skips reporting unused resources in libraries. Instead, run the unused resource check on the consuming app module (along with `checkDependencies=true`).

   However, there are cases where you want to check that all the resources declared in a library are used; in that case, you can disable the skip option.

   To configure this option, use a `lint.xml` file with an <option> like this:

   ```xml
   <lint>
       <issue id="UnusedResources">
           <option name="skip-libraries" value="true" />
       </issue>
   </lint>
   ```
